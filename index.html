        <p class="bodyText">Technological advances have made web applications beneficial and effective tools in managing our health. There are applications for dieting, exercising, nutrition, sleep tracking, meditation and so many others! In addition, there are multiple medical devices that record an individual's heart beat and other health statistics such as the <a href="https://www.stemoscope.com">Stemoscope</a>.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">What if there was an application that provided an individual the opportunity to mediate to one’s own heartbeat? Or provides the option to combine and sync two heartbeats?</p>
  
        <p class="bodyText">The goal of this web application is to provide both options for an individual’s meaningful individualized mediation.</p>
     
          <ul class="listItems">
            <li>&#9829 Provide user interface to allow for uploading sound files.</li>
            <li>&#9829 Allow user to edit sound files (Play, Pause, Stop, Speed, Volume, White Noise Removal, Merge).</li>
            <li>&#9829 Allow user to Save & Share files.</li>

        <p class="bodyText">Of the many lessons and tools provided by <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/codergirl">LaunchCode’s CoderGirl</a>, one of the most valuable has been to start off small and build from that. A grand idea is nothing without basic functionality and implementation. I realize there is still much to learn! But even though it may seem daunting, I am optimistic this development plan will help provide a strong foundation on which to prepare this web application.</p>

            <li>&#9829 Design Content and Prepare References.</li>
            <li>&#9829 Coding Preparation - research possible API's to incorporate (<a href="https://github.com/Pizzicato">Pizzacato</a>), create file structure (including test spec and "README" files), set up server.</li>
